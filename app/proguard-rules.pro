# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;
#}

# Uncomment this to preserve the line number information for
# debugging stack traces.
#-keepattributes SourceFile,LineNumberTable

# If you keep the line number information, uncomment this to
# hide the original source file name.
#-renamesourcefileattribute SourceFile

# Keep Kotlin metadata so that reflection based serializers (Jackson, Moshi, etc.)
# can continue to discover data class properties in release builds.
-keep class kotlin.Metadata { *; }

# Preserve the Health Connect data models that are cached via Jackson so the
# generated JSON keeps the expected field names.
-keep class me.ayra.ha.healthconnect.data.** { *; }
